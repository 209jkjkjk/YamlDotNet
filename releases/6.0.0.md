# Release 6.0.0

This release merges the YamlDotNet.Signed and YamlDotNet packages.
This change has the following consequences:
  
  - The **assemblies in the YamlDotNet package will now have strong names**.  
    This is a breaking change. If you depend on a library that depends on a
    previous version of YamlDotNet, you will first need to update that library.
    
  - The **YamlDotNet.Signed package will cease to be published**.  
    The code should be updated to depend on YamlDotNet.
