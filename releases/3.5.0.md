# Release 3.5.0

* Add native support of System.Guid serialization.
* Add properties to YamlMemberAttribute:
    * Order: specifies the order of the members when they are serialized.
    * Alias: instructs the deserializer to use a different field name for serialization.
* The YamlAliasAttribute is now obsolete. New code should use YamlMemberAttribute instead.
* Throw proper exceptions, with correct marks, when deserialization of a node fails.
