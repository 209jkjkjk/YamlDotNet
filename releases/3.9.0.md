# Release 3.9.0

New features:

* Add YamlVisitorBase as an improved replacement for YamlVisitor
  * **YamlVisitor is now obsolete**, and will be removed in a future release.
* Ensure compatibility with AOT compilation, for platforms that do not allow dynamic code generation, such as IOS or PS4.
* Add Yaml attribute overrides feature, similar to XML Serializer attribute overrides behavior.
* Add a YamlNodeType enumeration property to nodes.

Bug fixes:

* Fix #166 - Guid conversion to JSON is unquoted.
* Ignore enum value case during deserialization.
* Improve newline handling
  * In some cases, consecutive newlines were incorrectly parsed or emitted.
* Fix #177 - double.MaxValue serialization.
* Register custom type converters with higher precedence than the built-in converters.
