# Release 4.2.0

## New features

* **Support for .NET Core (`netstandard1.3`).**  
  The project files have been converted to the new format, which means that older versions of Visual Studio may be unable to load them.

## Development-related changes

* YamlDotNet now uses [Cake](http://cakebuild.net/) to define the build script. Previously, custom powershell scripts were used.

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) images are now available with everything that is required to build YamlDotNet, both [locally](https://hub.docker.com/r/aaubry/yamldotnet.local/), and on [Travis](https://hub.docker.com/r/aaubry/yamldotnet/). This is mostly useful for people wanting to develop on Linux, as it can be tricky to install the correct versions of the dependencies.

* **Code samples are now part of the solution**  
  They are specified as tests, and the [samples](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/wiki/Samples) section of the wiki is generated from their source code and their output.
