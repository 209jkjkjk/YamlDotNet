# Release 4.1.0

## New features

* 32bits Unicode code points in escape sequences and url-encoded tags [are now properly handled](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/219).
* [Anchors can now be redefined](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/222) in a document.  
  This is to conform to [the 1.1 spec](http://yaml.org/spec/1.1/#id863390) as well as [the 1.2 spec](http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2765878):
  
  > ### 3.2.2.2. Anchors and Aliases
  > When composing a representation graph from serialized events, an alias node refers to the most recent node in the serialization having the specified anchor. Therefore, anchors need not be unique within a serialization.
* Added support for [tag mappings on the serializer](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/229).  
  Use `SerializerBuilder.WithTagMapping()` to register a new tag mapping on the serializer.
* Allow to [unregister components](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/commit/43c18ecf482dd069784a2031d8d56c1fa3a81734) from the SerializerBuilder and DeserializerBuilder.  
  Use the `Without...` methods on `SerializerBuilder` and `DeserializerBuilder` for that.
* New [`DateTimeConverter`](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/234)  
  * It accepts [`DateTimeKind.Utc`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/shx7s921(v=vs.110).aspx) and [Standard Date and Time Format Strings](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/az4se3k1(v=vs.110).aspx) of "G" as its default parameters, if they are omitted.
  * For deserialization, it accepts as many number of formats as we want. If a value doesn't match against provided formats, it will return [`FormatException`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.formatexception(v=vs.110).aspx). Please refer to my whole test cases.
  * For serialization, it only considers the first format in the format list.
* Improve the (de)serializer builders so that it is possible to [wrap existing component registrations](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/commit/204ff4979dca7e2cfcbe86cd1387bf6b6f2398c3).
* Added the `ApplyNamingConventions` property to `YamlMemberAttribute`.  
  When this property is true, naming conventions are not applied to the associated member. This solves [issue 228](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/issues/228).

## Bug fixes

* Fixed [issue 189](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/205): extra '\0' after indentation indicators.
* Fixed [some issues](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/commit/a662fe53e9fd351eee7eef195e617023fd4e1cd3) related to parsing and emitting comments.
* Fixed [deserialization of ulongs](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/commit/62bcaacf5873f9fd94385a20200028595a1381a7) greater than long.MaxValue.
* Fixed [issue 218](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/issues/218): Objects with custom type converters are traversed.
* [Avoid crashing with a StackOverflowException](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/pull/223) when iterating over the AllNodes property when it's infinitely recursive.

## Other

* The samples have been added to the project as a new unit test project, to ensure that they stay up-to-date with the code.
  In the future, a documentation page will be generated from the samples, that will show the sample, its documentation and respective output.
