# Release 3.8.0

New features:

* **Add support for different scalar integer bases.**  
  Addresses issue [#113](https://github.com/aaubry/YamlDotNet/issues/113). Adds basic support for deserializing scalar integers
  written in binary, octal, decimal, hex, and base 60, as allowed in the YAML
  specification; see http://yaml.org/type/int.html. Adds unit tests for each
  of these bases as well.
* **Add dnx compatibility to the NuGet packages.**
* Do not throw exception if a tag does not contain a valid type name.

Fixes and improvements:

* Cache type metadata.
* Fix wrong type when deserializing UInt16.
* Fix handling of special float values, such as NaN, PositiveInfinity and NegativeInfinity.
* Properly quote empty strings.
* Properly handle non-Unicode encodings when emitting scalars.
