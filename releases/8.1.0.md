# Release 8.1.0

## New features and improvements

- Made CachedTypeInspector thread safe #386  
  Previously, using an instance of `Serializer` or `Deserializer` was not thread-safe,
  although the intention was for them to be thread safe. The only mutable state is
  inside CachedTypeInspector and was not properly protected against concurrent mutation.

## Other fixes

- Fix type conflicts when targeting frameworks without nullability attributes #460
